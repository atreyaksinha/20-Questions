# 20-Questions

This implements a class that represents a tree of questions and answers.

20 Questions is a guessing game in which the objective is to ask yes/no questions to determine an object. In our version, the human begins a round by choosing some object, and the computer attempts to guess that object by asking a series of yes/no questions until it thinks it knows the answer. Then, the computer makes a guess; if its guess is correct, the computer wins, and otherwise you win. If the computer loses, it will add the object you were thinking of to its knowledge base.
